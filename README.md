# README
I have used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/), [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) and [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?q=students&o=r) for styling.
I didn't use any other external libraries besides the ones mentioned in the problem statement (django, json)      

Assumptions:
- In part 2, The username and password will only contain alphabets or numbers
- Instead of adding a back button to go to each previous page, I have put a navbar which contains links to the home page and create a post page. Plus a link to the original post page in the comments page navbar
- The "button to go to individual posts" is just put as hyperlink with it's text being the posts' title.
- Website will only be used on desktop
- As I used bootstrap and fontawesome, both parts will only be opened when connected to internet
